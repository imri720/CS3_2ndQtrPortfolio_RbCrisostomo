### Q1 End of Lessons Reflection
**Imanuel C. Crisostomo** <br>
**9-Rubidium** <br> <br>

### *List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well.* <br>
1. JavaScript Overview and Introduction
- *JavaScript was something that I never expected to learn as quickly as I did. JS was very fun to program on, since it was very similar to C++, which was my favorite of the two coding languages we studied in Grade 7-8, the other being Python.* 
<br></br>

2. JS Variable Declarations
- *JS variable declarations were also pretty fun to learn. The usages of "let", "const", and "var" was a pretty nice change from C++'s "int".* 
<br></br>

3. JS Operators
- *The operators in JS were also very similar to C++'s operators, which, aside from making them easier to understand, also allowed for a more extensive variety of possibilities. For example, the "===" or "strictly equal to" operator can be used in differenciating the number 5 from a string '5'.*
<br></br>

4. Loop Control Structures
- *This topic was one of my favorite ones in CS2 C++. My personal favorites were the for and while. Too bad there weren't much switch statements, that was my top 1. Anyways, the loop control structures were easy for me because, again, they were part of C++ topics in CS2.*
<br></br>

5. Markdowns
- *The first topic unrelated to JS in this list: markdowns. Even though markdowns weren't thoroughly discussed in class, it was still very easy to grasp because of the activities Sir Roy gave us (bonuses, portfolio formatting, even this lesson reflection.) Sir Roy gave us a way through guides and tasks to embrace markdowns and learn it fully and efficiently.*


### <br> *List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but needs further practice/discussion and why.* </br>
1. HTML
- *Although it was the very first language discussed in CS3, I feel like it got completely overshadowed by JS in the following lessons. Sometimes I even forget that we even learned HTML at all, and it barely appeared in the LTs. While HTML had a nice introduction through the portfolio and Graded tasks 1-3, it ultimately became overlooked because of JS being the main language used in CS3.*
<br></br>

2. Github
- *Github is where this and the other codes in student's portfolios are stored. While now it is easy to retrieve your repository, make profiles, and understand some of the UI, I feel like the whole Github wasn't fully dwelled upon yet. Things such as topics, the community, collections, etc. While Github was used as a storage tool for this portfolio, the whole platform wasn't fully explored yet, possibly to focus on the actual topics in CS3.*
<br></br>   

3. Input/Output Statements
- *Aside from graded tasks 2-3, not much was discussed about I/O statements in JavaScript. The main topics were declarations, operations, and structures, not so much on JS statements, since these were mostly the ones showing up in actual LTs.*
<br></br>

4. Functions
- *I really never fully grasped this topic, even though it was discussed. Maybe it's just me. Functions was never my best bet, even in back in CS2.*
<br></br>

5. Event Handlers
- *This last topic is something never discussed in class, even though it was in KHub's week 6 along with JS functions. I just know about it because I reviewed a bit of it just in case it shows up in the second LT.*

### <br> *Describe on what will be your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed on the second items.* </br>

- *For most of the coding topics, I feel like the best way for me to be able to understand these further is by making codes of my own outside of activities given for CS3 using these stuff in my own programs. It will help me explore the ways in which they are used and and applied.*

### <br> *In the activities that were done in class, list at least two that you think were effective and at least two that you think not effective in helping you understand topics in our course and why?* </br>

#### *Effective*
1. 1st Non-graded Exercise
- *I think it was very helpful for me to get into HTML, since it was very different from C++ back in CS2. With it being the first activity, I feel like it was very helpful for me.*
2. 7th Graded Exercise
- *Since functions was one of my weaknesses in CS, this activity helped me wrap my head around it a little more (even though it was kinda confusing at first).*
<br></br>

#### *Ineffective*
- *I think all of the exercises were already effective in some way; they all helped and guided me through the topic it was on about.*
